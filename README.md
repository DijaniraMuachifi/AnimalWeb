### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development, structure, and features of the **Animals Names** web application, which showcases information about animals and their appearances in literary novels, particularly focusing on the works of **István Fekete**. The system is designed to be simple yet functional, providing an intuitive interface for exploring animal-related data and a robust administrative panel for managing the content.

**Objective of the System**:  
The primary goal of the system is to create an interactive platform where users can browse through animal-related information from **István Fekete's** novels. Key features include:

- A responsive interface for easy navigation.
- Administrative tools for managing content such as adding, updating, and deleting entries.
- Integration of interactive charts to visualize data effectively.

### 5. Design and User Interface

The **Animals Names** project uses **Bootstrap 5** for a modern, responsive design. The client interface is user-friendly, with a navigation menu at the top and easy access to key features from the homepage.

#### Client Layout:
- **Home**: Lists animals with links to detailed pages.
- **About**: Explains the system concept and information about István Fekete's novels.
- **Login**: Page for users to log in to access restricted features.

#### Navigation Menu:
The navigation menu, built using **Bootstrap**, provides an easy-to-navigate layout across devices.

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.php">Animals Name</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
      <li class="nav-item active"><a class="nav-link" href="index.php">Home</a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="about.php">About</a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="login.php">Login</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

#### Chart.js Integration:
Interactive charts display the frequency of animal appearances in novels.

```html
<canvas id="animalChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
  var ctx = document.getElementById('animalChart').getContext('2d');
  var animalChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
      labels: ['Novel 1', 'Novel 2', 'Novel 3'],
      datasets: [{
        label: 'Animal Appearances',
        data: [12, 19, 3],
        backgroundColor: ['rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)'],
        borderColor: ['rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)'],
        borderWidth: 1
      }]
    },
    options: { scales: { y: { beginAtZero: true } } }
  });
</script>
```

### 6. System Administration

The admin panel provides various tools for managing and monitoring the system, including:

- **Animal and Novel Management**: Admins can modify or delete data.
- **User Metrics and Activity Monitoring**: Visual insights into system performance and activity.
- **Access Control**: Admins manage user roles and permissions.

---

### 7. Code Example and Explanation

The code validates user login credentials using PHP and interacts with the database to authenticate users:

```php
// Database connection setup
require_once './php/config.php';

// Login logic
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];

    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
    $result = $app->executeQuery($query);

    if ($result) {
        header('Location: dashboard.php');
    } else {
        echo "Invalid credentials.";
    }
}
```
